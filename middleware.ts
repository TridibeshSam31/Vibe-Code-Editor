/*
in route type check what are we actually doing  and whatare the purpose of these methods startswith(),includes() why are we using these ???

const isApiAuthRoute = nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(apiAuthPrefix);

1.startswith()
Purpose: Checks if the current URL path begins with a given string.
Example:
"/api/auth/signin".startsWith("/api/auth") // true
"/api/users".startsWith("/api/auth")       // false

Why here? All NextAuth’s built-in API endpoints start with /api/auth/....
So this lets us quickly identify "Is the request hitting the NextAuth API endpoints?"

2.includes()

const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.includes(nextUrl.pathname);
const isAuthRoute = authRoutes.includes(nextUrl.pathname);

Purpose: Checks if a value exists in an array.

example
const publicRoutes = ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
publicRoutes.includes("/")        // true
publicRoutes.includes("/profile") // false


Why here?

publicRoutes is a list of pages anyone can see without logging in.
authRoutes is a list of login/signup routes.
So we’re just asking: “Does the current route match one of these lists?”


So basically:

startsWith → prefix check (used when the path is dynamic but always begins the same way).

includes → exact match check (used when you have a finite, predefined set of routes).
